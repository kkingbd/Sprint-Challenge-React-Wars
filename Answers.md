1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
To think in react means to think of creating applications with small reusable chunks of code called components.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Functional/Presentational components are simpler and have less functionality than class components and can be passed props. However, Functional components don't have states. Class/stateful components have access to state and life cycle methods.

1.  Describe state.
State describes the part of the application that can handle changes.

1.  Describe props.
Props are data that can be passed into a component that allow for application communitcation. This data can then be passed from parent to child and is immutable.
